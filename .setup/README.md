# Setup directory

All setup/configure scripts for different categories are located here. You can create either a simple script or a directory with scripts (it is advisable to name everything according to the category convention, so as not to get confused)

Example:
```
.setup
├── pictures
│   ├── link-main.sh
│   └── post-setup.sh
├── i3.sh
├── README.md
└── zsh.sh
```
